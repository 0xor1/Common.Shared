Common
======

Common classes I use in all of my projects:

* Common.Shared for both client and server side usage.
* Common.Client for only client side usage.
* Common.Server for only server side usage.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project you need `.net core 7`, `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
